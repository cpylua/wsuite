Download this: http://www.hidedragon.com/cn/HideDragon32_full.exe to perform a test.
Note, you should download the full version, only that can hide processes.

1.
Please make sure your psapi.dll' version is 5.1 or higher,
if not, you can copy the newer version from an Windows XP or higher.

2.
Not fully tested on all versions of NT based systems, so there may be some bugs.
Win9x not supported.

3.
If the scan result is obviously wrong,please reboot then run it again.
This may happen sometimes, I don't know why.

4.
The scan result may NOT be accurate, do NOT rely on it.

5.
This is only a demo, it's not intended for daily use.
You may use other anti-rootkit tools to detect threats, see http://www.antirootkit.com/software/index.htm
